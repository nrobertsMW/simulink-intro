# Introduction to Simulink for System Modeling and Simulation

## Abstract
In this session you will learn the basics of Simulink for modeling, simulating, and analyzing multidomain dynamical systems. You will see how to build simulation models using Simulinkâ€™s block diagramming interface, customizable set of libraries, and connectivity to MATLAB.   Key highlights include:

- Introduction to Simulink 
- Modeling and simulating multidomain physical systems
- Overview of control system design and tuning
- Viewing simulation results 
- Examples of different Simulink applications 
- How to get started with Simulink
